## 🔄 Query Modifications

### **Before (Broken):**
```sql
-- In teacher/batch_assignments.php
SELECT a.* FROM assignments a WHERE a.batch_id = ?

-- In teacher/batch_grades.php  
SELECT s.* FROM submissions s JOIN assignments a ON s.assignment_id = a.id WHERE a.batch_id = ?
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```sql
-- In teacher/batch_assignments.php
SELECT a.* FROM assignments a 
JOIN batch_courses bc ON a.course_id = bc.course_id 
WHERE bc.batch_id = ?

-- In teacher/batch_grades.php
SELECT s.* FROM submissions s 
JOIN assignments a ON s.assignment_id = a.id 
JOIN batch_courses bc ON a.course_id = bc.course_id 
WHERE bc.batch_id = ?
```
